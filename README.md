Hello! Thank you for checking out my IT Heatmap Project!

A majority of the code can be found in the src/ folder.

An independant 'index.html' can be opened directly for a prototype of what I was going for that is built using pure HTML/vanilla JS.

The 'React framework' was used afterwards to further develop this into a more capable project that could be expanded on.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
